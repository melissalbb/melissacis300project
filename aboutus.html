    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>
      We are a group of passionate travelers, storytellers, and explorers with a love for the South of France. 
      From the glamorous Riviera to the quiet lavender fields of Provence, we aim to capture the true essence of this breathtaking region. 
      Our mission is to inspire meaningful travel by combining culture, history, cuisine, and hidden gems into one curated guide.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>
      Our platform goes beyond simple travel tips. We craft detailed itineraries, design personalized road trips, 
      and provide up-to-date recommendations for food, wine, and local experiences. Whether you're looking for 
      luxury escapes in Saint-Tropez, authentic village markets in Gordes, or beachside relaxation in Nice, we bring 
      together everything you need to plan your journey.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Promise</h2>
    <p>
      Travel should be unforgettable and effortless. That’s why we’ve created tools to help you build your perfect itinerary. 
      With our Trip Planner, you can customize every detail or choose from carefully designed journeys created by our team. 
      We focus on sustainability, authenticity, and meaningful connections so every trip leaves you with memories for a lifetime.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Choose Us</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike large travel platforms, we focus exclusively on the South of France, allowing us to provide insider knowledge and 
      genuine recommendations. Each destination and activity we share has been thoughtfully selected with a traveler’s eye for detail.
      Our goal is not only to guide you but to make you feel like a local exploring a place you can truly call home.
